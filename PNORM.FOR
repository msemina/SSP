C        SUBROUTINE PNORM
C
C        PURPOSE
C           NORMALIZE COEFFICIENT VECTOR OF A POLYNOMIAL
C
C        USAGE
C           CALL PNORM(X,IDIMX,EPS)
C
C        DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
C           X      - VECTOR OF ORIGINAL COEFFICIENTS, ORDERED FROM
C                    SMALLEST TO LARGEST POWER. IT REMAINS UNCHANGED
C           IDIMX  - DIMENSION OF X. IT IS REPLACED BY FINAL DIMENSION
C           EPS    - TOLERANCE BELOW WHICH COEFFICIENT IS ELIMINATED
C
C        REMARKS
C           IF ALL COEFFICIENTS ARE LESS THAN EPS, RESULT IS A ZERO
C           POLYNOMIAL WITH IDIMX=0 BUT VECTOR X REMAINS INTACT
C
C        SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
C           NONE
C
C        METHOD
C           DIMENSION OF VECTOR X IS REDUCED BY ONE FOR EACH TRAILING
C           COEFFICIENT WITH AN ABSOLUTE VALUE LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO EPS

    1 IF(IDIMX) 4,4,2
    2 IF(ABS(X(IDIMX))-EPS) 3,3,4
    3 IDIMX=IDIMX-1
      GO TO 1
    4 RETURN
      END
