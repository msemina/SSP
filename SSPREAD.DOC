            This software is a minimal adaptation of the 1960's IBM  SHARE  tape  to
            run on an MS-DOS or PC-DOS personal computer. The only changes that have
            been made  have  been  made  to  make  the   subroutines  compile  under
            Microsoft Fortran. All modules compile under Microsoft Fortran, however,
            several of the modules generate warnings because they have ancient  code
            that likes to jump in and out of DO-loops.  In addition, the line number
            identifications have been stripped off the modules to reduce the  module
            size.
            
            Complete source is provided for each  module  in  the  original  Fortran
            "spagetti  code"  style.  This  code  is  provided  this way so that the
            original code survives without errors which have been introduced as each
            of the modules have been copied and republished in various texts through
            the past 20 years.
            
            This code is provided as "Shareware" or "Donationware"  or  "Beggerware"
            depending  upon  your  outlook  of monetary solicitations in the current
            vogue in the personal computer software arena. I have spent the past two
            years,  part  time, working on these modules and now release them to you
            for possible use. Please feel free to use them in any way you  see  fit.
            If  you  pass  these on to someone else, please pass them on in complete
            form with the documentation intact.
            
            If you think that my efforts should be rewarded, I  would  appreciate  a
            donation to the address listed below.  I am suggesting that $30.00 would
            be very nice. If you would like  a  copy  of  the  original  SHARE  tape
            downloaded  onto  floppies  I  will  supply  that  also  for  media  and
            preparation donations, again, to the address listed below, as follows:
            
            
                      Non-archived files on 10 floppies
                      (total of 40496 lines of code)                $ 75.00
            
                      Archived files (10 archives) on two floppies
                      (same lines of code)                          $ 39.95
            
            
            Note that these files are not split into modules but are 80 column  card
            images  downloaded  onto  floppies including sequence id's in columns 73
            through 80. The files are split between modules, not at  arbitrary  line
            numbers.
            
            In addition, I have converted these modules into F77 format. I  did  not
            use  block structured IF - ELSE IF - ELSE constructions, but left the GO
            TO statements at obvious, visible spots for ready conversion.  This  was
            done  because  I  had  a  need to be able to compile these modules using
            mainframe compilers that did not support the F77 constructs.  The  code,
            however,  is  reformatted  to  be  much  more readible, using logical IF
            statements to restore some of the sense that the original  authors  were
            trying  to  accomplish.  I  have,  however,  eliminated  the  forest  of
            convoluted arithmetic IF statements with multiple, unreadable  statement
            label transfers whenever possible.

            Note that this copy will be copyrighted  but  will  include  all  source
            modules,  and,  as  I  prepare  them,  drivers and example programs. For
            schools and plants desiring a site license, I will make these available.
            Please contact me at the above address.
            
            It is my intentions  to  translate  these  modules  into  several  other
            languages  and  make  the source available to other users. If I see that
            this concept is well received (you know how I am going to measure this),
            then  I  will  hurry  these  translations.  The  languages  I  intend to
            translate these modules to include C, Turbo Pascal,  Quick  Basic,  and,
            possibly,  Ada and Modula-2.  Please let me know which of these you find
            the most interesting and would like to see first. I am  planning  to  do
            the C version first.
            
            I hope the others of you who are writing Shareware  (etc.)  programs  or
            are  placing  programs into the public domain (even better) will include
            the sources. I am also working on a number of BIOS  revisions  and  hard
            disk  (>32MB)  partitioning  programs.  I  plan to put these into either
            shareware or into the public domain. When I do so, I will include source
            whenever possible.
